#Temporarily Bypass Fortiguard
#####Chrome extension to do that automatically

This extension is called whenever a fortiguard page is found, which then redirects through a proxy server. 

This extension was created for the benefit of many. The proxies are bound to get blocked someday but you can delay it if you use it with discretion.
